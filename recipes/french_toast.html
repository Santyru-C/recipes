        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This is a good, old-fashioned way of making delicious French 
            toast. To add a little pizzazz to it, sprinkle on some 
            cinnamon after dipping the bread into the batter. 
            Serve hot with butter and maple syrup.           
        </p>
