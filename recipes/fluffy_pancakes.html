        <p>Tall and fluffy. These pancakes are just right. 
            Topped with strawberries and whipped cream, 
            they are impossible to resist. 
        </p>

        <h4>Ingredients (yields 4 servings)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 egg </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine milk with vinegar in a medium bowl and set aside 
                for 5 minutes to "sour".
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt 
                in a large mixing bowl. Whisk egg and butter into "soured" milk. 
                Pour the flour mixture into the wet ingredients and whisk until 
                lumps are gone.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. 
                Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles 
                appear on the surface. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned 
                on the other side.
            </li>
        </ol>
